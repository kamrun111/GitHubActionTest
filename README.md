# GitHub Actions Test CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains a simple **CI/CD pipeline** for a Python project, set up using **GitHub Actions**. It's designed as a basic test to get familiar with the process of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how you can automatically run tests and deploy your code using **GitHub Actions** every time you push updates to your repository.

This could be a helpful resource for beginners who want to learn how to set up and use **CI/CD pipelines** in their projects.

## 🔧 Features

- **Automated Testing:** Runs tests automatically on every push to the repository.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Deploys the project to a designated environment if the tests pass successfully.
- **Simple Setup:** The CI/CD pipeline is configured using a straightforward `.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory.

## 📋 Requirements

- A GitHub account.
- A basic understanding of Python and GitHub.
- Familiarity with GitHub Actions (although this example is simple enough for beginners).

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kamrun111/GitHubActionTest.git
   cd GitHubActionTest
   ```

2. **Setup Your Python Environment:**
   Make sure you have Python installed on your machine, then create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add Your Tests:**
   Write your test cases in the `tests/` directory. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run them each time you push code.

4. **Push Changes:**
   Commit and push your changes to GitHub, and the GitHub Actions will run the CI/CD pipeline.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add tests"
   git push origin main
   ```
